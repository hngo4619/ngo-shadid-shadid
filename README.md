## Riftify Me!
This project is a Software Engineering Capstone developed by Huy Ngo, Sam Shadid, and Zack Shadid at the University of Oklahoma in collaboration with ExxonMobil and Ethan Martin.

The Riftify Me! web application's core purpose is to take 3D object file in .obj or .stl file formats and render it within the web browser in a way that it is viewable on the Oculus Rift.

## Libraries and Frameworks
- HTML/CSS: Bootstrap
- JavaScript: Dropzone.JS, Three.JS, and OculusBridge.JS
- Webserver: Ubuntu Server 14.10 running on a VM instance on Microsoft Azure with Lighttpd and PHP installed

## Installation and Documentation
The installation and documentation information can be seen in the user manual and documentation file that should be attached along with this source code. The website can be set up as any typical website, provided the web server has PHP support. The various libraries that we utilized were all open source and are as follows: Three.js, Dropzone.js, RiftCamera.js, OculusBridge.js, and OrbitControls.js.

Thank you to ExxonMobil and Ethan Martin for mentoring and supporting our project throughout the entire development process!
